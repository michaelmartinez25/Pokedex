## App Ideas
1. Real-time Language Translation
   - This app will allow users to speak into the microphone of a mobile device and produce a real-time translation of what was said.
3. **Pokedex** (Top 2 Candidate)
   - This app will allow users to search for information about any Pokemon, including images, details, cries, movesets, evolution methods, etc.
5. **Time Tracker** (Top 2 Candidate)
   - This app is meant to help users keep track of how long it takes to complete activities. For example, one could use it to keep track of their progress through Leetcode solve times, or how long it took them to clean their dorm.
4. Travel Planner
    - This app will assist users in planning trips, including iternary creation, booking accommodations, finding attractions, and navigation.

## App Idea Evaluation
1. Pokedex
    - **Description**: Serves as a companion app for players of Pokemon Red and Pokemon Blue. The app will include information about all 151 Pokemon, including sprites, movesets, locations, and evolution methods.
    - **Category**: Entertainment
    - **Mobile**: Like the Pokedex is a mobile device in the games, this app will serve as a companion app that can be open while you play. Users can use the camera to take a snapshot of a Pokemon to retrieve its information. Users will also be able to unlock more information by registering Pokemon as captured.
    - **Story**: This app provides a fresh experience for Pokemon players, as this app provides an immersive, in-game-like experience. The unlock-as-you-play mode is entirely optional, serving users who want a fresh experience or a traditional experience where all information is displayed. 
    - **Market**: Pokemon is one of the most popular and widely-played video games. This app is for users who want an fun, gamified way to keep track of their Pokedex progress. This app will also serve users who want a traditional experience where all the info they need is at their fingertips.
    - **Habit**: Users will likely open and use this app as they play Pokemon Red/Blue. This app can help users keep track of the many Pokemon they encounter throughout their journey.
    - **Scope**: This app will be technically challenging, as it requires the use of APIs, camera functionality, and be able to identify Pokemon from an image. A stripped-down version of the app may look like a traditional Pokedex app without the unlock-as-you-play mode implemented, which is still very useful.
3. Time Tracker
    - **Description**: Serves as a tool to keep track of time spent completing tasks. Users can see patterns in their completion times and keep track of a variety of tasks through folders. Users can also keep track of total time spent completing larger tasks that take multiple sessions.
    - **Category**: Productivity
    - **Mobile**: This app will be useful to have on your phone as you complete tasks. It can feature push notifications to remind users of checkpoints or milestones in time spent.
    - **Story**: The value lies in the customization features of the app. The app is aimed to be user-central, as they get to freely organize and set how they want to app to work for them.
    - **Market**: I can see this app having a potentially large user base. Rather than having a niche user-base target, this app can be picked up by anyone wanting to keep track of completion time progress.
    - **Habit**: An average user would open and use this app when they would like to keep track of time spent completing a task. 
    - **Scope**: This app will implement timers, logs, and a smooth UI, so it may be mildly challenging. A stripped-down version of the app is the goal, as it should minimalistic and up to the user to customize and build that way.

## The Final Decision
I decided to pursue the Pokedex app.
